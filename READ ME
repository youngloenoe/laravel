// THE first step to creating anything after everything is set up is to alter the web.php folder and add a route to your new view.
// THEN create the file in the views folder
// You can send data from the route to the view
// For blade language info check the laravel docs.
// Remember to put the logic inside the controller - to create one do php artisan make:controller controllernameController
//To create a table in the database you need to alter 
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
in the .env file, and also create a table with the same name in phpmyadmin. After that you need to run php artisan migrate inside the project folder.
